"""
This module implements the classic game hangman.

The goal of the game for the player is to guess a word the computer chose by
guessing individual letters. If one of the letters is part of the chosen word,
the computer tells the player the positions of all occurences.

The game consists of multiple rounds where the player can guess a letter
when prompted to do so.

If the guessed letter is in the word the computer chose, the game state is
updated and the player is presented with the positions of the letters they
guessed correctly.

If the guess was wrong, that means it is not part of the guess word, it is
added to the list of wrong guesses.

If the player guesses all letters before the number of wrong guesses
exceeds the number of allowed misses, they win. Otherwise the computer
wins.
