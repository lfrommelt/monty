comments / docstrings
	comments before lines that are described
	comments get indented as well
	WE WILL DEDUCT POINTS.

spacing and empty lines

use functions to structure your code

general code structure: imports, function definitions first

if __name__ == "__main__":

use _ in for loops where you don't need the variable

pythonic / concise ways for solving common problems:
	list comprehensions
	ternary operator
	enumerate
	"string" * n
	* unpacking
	tuple unpacking in general

very briefly talk about efficiency

never trust user input

naming: do NOT use built in names!!!!

======================================================
	
Error Handling:

understanding error messages: types of errors and what they mean

try except

"EOL"; "EOF"

BPB 2018 07 slide 46

logging

example for error without error message:

text = text.splitlines()

for i, elem in enumerate(text):
    if elem == "":
        text.pop(i)
