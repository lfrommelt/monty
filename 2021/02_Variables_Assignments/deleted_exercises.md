2. What will be displayed in your terminal if you run these lines of code?
   ```python
   print(2 + 2)
   print('2' + '2')
   ```
   ::: solution
   ```python
   4   # type: int
   22  # type: str
   ```

2. What is the function of the `+` sign in each case?

:::solution
First line: the `+` sign is used as an operator to add two integers.

Second line: the `+` sign is used to concatenate strings.

## Common operators: Division

1. What is the difference between `/` and `//`?

   :::solution
      - `/` is used to divide the left side before the `/` operator by the right side after the `/` operator.
          The result of this division always results in a float.

      - `//` is used as a floor division operator in Python.
           This means that the result of the division is rounded down to the next integer value.

2. What would be an application example for each one of the operations?

   :::solution
   ```{ .python .exec}
   # Dividend / Divisor = Quotient

   # set the values of the variables
   dividend = 5
   divisor = 2

   # dividing with /
   quotient_1 = dividend / divisor
   print(
       'The result of the division of 5 by 2 using the "/" operand, results in',
       quotient_1, '.')
   print('The result is of the type ', type(quotient_1), '.')

   # dividing with //
   quotient_2 = dividend // divisor
   print('The result of the division of 5 by 2 using the "//" operand, results in',
         quotient_2, '.')
   print('The result is of the type ', type(quotient_2), '.')
   ```
