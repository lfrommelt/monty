What do you think will be the output of this?  ``` print(1,2,3,4,sep='*') ```
ANSWER: 

Suppose x is defined as follows:  x = [     'a',     'b',     {         'foo': 1,         'bar':         {             'x' : 10,             'y' : 20,             'z' : 30         },         'baz': 3     },     'c',     'd' ] What is the expression involving x that accesses the value 30?  x[2]['bar']['z']   This isnâ€™t the only possibility, of course. For example, x[-3]['bar']['z'] would also work. But the answer above is probably the most obvious.
