For Windows:
Choose one:
(A)Forget it...(highly recomendet)
(B)Rewrite the Makefile and hope you are more lucky than I was
(C)Be creative

For Linux (tested on Ubuntu 18.04):
In the commands below "python3" will be used as if it is in the PATH. If it is not, replace it by the actual path to your python installation (e.g. /home/name/anaconda3/bin/python3)

1. Python: Make sure python >= 3.5 is installed somewhere.

2. pdflatex: texlive or Miktex should both be fine. For simplicity make sure to choose a version that already comes with a bunch of packages (texlive-latex-base was not enough, I used texlive-latex-full, which is clearly overkill (>4GB)). Texlive can be installed via apt-get, e.g.:

	sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-extra

I got a bug before updating to the newest apt-get version:

	sudo apt-get update


3. I highly recommend pip for doing all the package managing. Conda/mix of both seemed not to work.
	-update
	-Navigate to the 2021 folder and create a pip environment:
	
	python3 -m venv env
	(the name env should already be in .gitignore)

	-activate env

	env/bin/activate

	-install the packages:

	pip install pandoc
	pip install panflute==1.11.2
	pip install Pygments==2.2.0
	pip install pandoc-img-glob==0.1.3

Using requirements.txt for installing the packages lead to an error in my case.

For macOS:
Most should be the same as for linux. For pdflatex MacTeX is probably the right choice in this case.
