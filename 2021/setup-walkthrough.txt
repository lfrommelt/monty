For Windows:
Choose one:
(A)Forget it...(highly recomendet)
(B)Rewrite the Makefile and hope you are more lucky than I was
(C)Be creative

For Linux (tested on Ubuntu 18.04):
In the commands below "python3" will be used as if it is in the PATH. If it is not, replace it by the actual path to your python installation (e.g. /home/name/anaconda3/bin/python3)

1. Python: Make sure python >= 3.5 is installed somewhere.

2. pdflatex: texlive or Miktex should both be fine. For simplicity make sure to choose a version that already comes with a bunch of packages (texlive-latex-base was not enough, I used texlive-latex-full, which is clearly overkill (>4GB)). Texlive can be installed via apt-get, e.g.:

	sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-extra

I got a bug before updating to the newest apt-get version:

	sudo apt-get update


3. Use conda for package management. The file BaPyLatex.yml contains all the required versions and channels. When your base environment is activated and you are in the folder containing the .yml file you can use:

	conda env create -f BaPyLatex.yml
	conda activate BaPyLatex

Using requirements.txt for installing the packages lead to an error in my case.

For macOS:
Most should be the same as for linux. For pdflatex MacTeX is probably the right choice in this case.
